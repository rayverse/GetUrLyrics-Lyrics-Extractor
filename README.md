# GetUrLyrics-Lyrics-Extractor
‘GetUrLyrics’ is a powerful lyrics extractor tool that was created to make finding
lyrics to songs easy. This application is able to fetch lyrics of whatever songs by
whatever artists you’d like by simply searching the artist’s name and song’s
name.

Made for my python project, it uses azapi which is an inbuilt api in python that fetches lyrics from AZLyrics.com via google.com* and duckduckgo* for accurate results. Tkinter is used to create the gui.
